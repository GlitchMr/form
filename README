An implementation of Perl 6's Form module, as described by Exegesis 7 and Damian Conway's Perl6::Form module.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS and most likely doesn't work at any given time.

Current status: All bar one test files currently pass with Rakudo master. The plan is to have Form operational with all current functionality in time for inclusion in Rakudo *, after which new functionality will be added according to the TODO list.

TODO
====

* DOCUMENTATION
* Data specified as lists
* Numeric fields with decimal separator and justification
* Numeric fields with thousands separators and justification
* Currencies
* Rendering of Complex numbers (currently restricted to Real)
* Everything else


BUILDING AND RUNNING
====================

You will need ufo in order to build Form. Install it using proto, or see http://github.com/masak/ufo. You will also need a suitable Perl 6 implementation, which at the time of writing is probably Rakudo Perl.

Once you have ufo installed, just run:

$ ufo
$ make
$ make test
