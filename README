An implementation of Perl 6's Form module, as described by Exegesis 7 and Damian Conway's Perl6::Form module.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS and most likely doesn't work at any given time.

TODO
====

* Demo: HTML form generation
* Numeric fields with decimal separator and justification
* Numeric fields with thousands separators and justification
* Currencies
* Everything else


BUILDING AND RUNNING
====================

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test

Makefile.PL will examine your environment to find Rakudo.

If your Rakudo is configured as Parrot-inside-Rakudo (i.e. you got Rakudo
and built it using --gen-parrot), set RAKUDO_DIR to the top level Rakudo
directory.

If your Rakudo is inside Parrot, set PARROT_DIR to the top level Parrot
directory.

If the script misdetects PARROT_DIR or RAKUDO_DIR, specifying both in the
environment will allow you to correct that.

PERL6LIB must be set (TODO: what to? './lib' seems to be the minimum, but
something suggests we should do that ourselves)

TODO (how does this stack up for Proto users? Should Just Work, I hope)
