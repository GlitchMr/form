An implementation of Perl 6's Form module, as described by Exegesis 7 and Damian Conway's Perl6::Form module.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS and most likely doesn't work at any given time.

Note that Form.pm builds perfectly with Rakudo master but does not pass all tests due to a bug in grammar backtracking in NQP-rx. It is hoped that this will be fixed soon. (24/June/2010)

TODO
====

* Data specified as lists
* Numeric fields with decimal separator and justification
* Numeric fields with thousands separators and justification
* Currencies
* Rendering of Complex numbers (currently restricted to Real)
* Everything else


BUILDING AND RUNNING
====================

You will need ufo in order to build Form. Install it using proto, or see http://github.com/masak/ufo. You will also need a suitable Perl 6 implementation, which at the time of writing is probably Rakudo Perl.

Once you have ufo installed, just run:

$ ufo
$ make
$ make test
