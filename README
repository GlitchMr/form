An implementation of Perl 6's Form module, as described by Exegesis 7 and Damian Conway's Perl6::Form module.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS and most likely doesn't work at any given time.

Note that Form.pm builds perfectly with Rakudo master but does not pass all tests due to a bug in grammar backtracking in NQP-rx. It is hoped that this will be fixed soon. (24/June/2010)

* Data specified as lists
* Numeric fields with decimal separator and justification
* Numeric fields with thousands separators and justification
* Currencies
* Everything else


BUILDING AND RUNNING
====================

Form.pm uses a Makefile generated by the ufo script. The Makefile is included in the source tree, so just:

$ make
$ make test

This assumes that perl6 is in your path and points to something capable of running the things that Form.pm uses, which is probably a recent Rakudo.
