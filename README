An implementation of Perl 6's Form module, as described by Exegesis 7 and Damian Conway's Perl6::Form module.

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS and most likely doesn't work at any given time.

BUILDING AND RUNNING
====================

You will need ufo in order to build Form. Install it using panda, or see http://github.com/masak/ufo. You will also need a suitable Perl 6 implementation, which at the time of writing is probably Rakudo Perl.

Once you have ufo installed, just run:

$ ufo
$ make
$ make test

Since Form is a library, 'running' is something that should not really have ever been mentioned.
